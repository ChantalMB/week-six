1,Mon January 1,01/1912,January,1912. She is 57 Very dreary morning..and up rather late. Two good letters from Etta and Ern. Went out for short run and then wrote much.. Ros called up and I went in to 24 to goose. Just the females of fam and very jolly but still no mention of xmas. So queer. Talked of the Dekay party in eve and how near I came to NOT doing it. .. F and Olivia played VERY well and then I went home and slpt . Up late to go to Birkheads . Out so sorry Then to Mrs Vans also out alas. Wound up at Rumsey's and had charming visit talking to both. Stayed late and went in to 24 to syp. Was by fire with H when Rodman came in .. In hall as D descended with the necklac all came out. FUROR. They could not believe they had not done it.  Too funny . and all was well of course.   Aunt Julia came in and Ros and I decided to go to DeKays.  Carriage for ten clk and my treat R Chumley Jones went with. . I wore scarlet .. Crush of crowds of interesting people. Many int to me and the greates time. Dunn was there so beautiful and charming. It was a GIFT to meet him again and such meting . AND J. Wilkie. wonderful. and standing  near . . I am afraid of him... Augustus Thomas. was one . I felt almost too free and happy among admiring eyes and bending over heads.   This should not happen often I should deceive myself and think I could have it and that it was not too late for EYES. Home feelin very happy.
2,Tues January 2,01/1912,January,Woke full of the ones I had met so nearly last night with a consciousness of what dearth there is of contacts I desire This must be I suppose.   Wrote and went out .. short run . Scanty lunch here and rest . Then down to Susan and Madge Huntington's studio in S Wash Sq. How reminding of old days. Fine place and very artificial lly brutal work .. Some how right though as decoration . Jolly talk with Jonas Lie who was there. Hardly anyone else. Walked up and seemed short . Left card on Miss Bigelow and Mrs Guerin. out alas. Dear box from Terence with misteltoe and sprig of holly. D came in as I wrote and stayed to din rather provoking queerly impertinent.   I read A.P.A's James book .. Thoma Davidson. ..
3,Wed January 3,01/1912,January,"Went out early shopped and wrote . Queer days these but I need the rest and it is good for a while. Was ready at four for F. Rumsey but she did not come till half past. So queer to be waiting for such things. Were having tea when Fitchie came and stayed after F R went. Talk with R about Joanna of course always. Persuaded Fitchie to go with me to the French's to see his Lincoln now on view. Walked down and found crowd at 5.30. Was tremendously impressed. It is MY Lincoln and I think all who care for him will feel it. It is ordingary plastically. but great in conception and feeling. for the PERSON. Saw many people of course Met Tracy going out . and shall not have him here He returns next winter. Dr Valentino .. The Johnsons and many others. At last caught sight of John Wilkie coming in and that was the end of the other people. He told me that his adoratio n of Lincoln when he was a boy was so great that he called himself after him. D was there and I had a chance to tell it Mr French what I thought of IT. He seemd pleased. J L, W. walked all the way with us. I like him always better. Makes me think sometimes of LANGLEY. The same deepsouled strength. Dined here and sat alone eve. Willing to and almost happy."

I fixed to have hi go to the Havemeyers this aft. T came and we took the underground down to Wall st and I went in to the fine old church in the first time for many years.

The lame sisterin law in wheeled chair. looking very intelligent and brave and in some ways good looking even though she is a real cripple.  Two dear little boys were running about..and M Audriffex and another Frenchma an artist. Also a beautiful girl. ALL these people spoke from French fluently and all the time. It was very gay. but I was abased as I never have been before by and such thing. I have forgotten all I ever knew. Later Mr Welling came in and his french was about like mine. It was Horrible. J.W came home with me in cab and I dont really know how much he now thinks of me or my charm. To be ignorant and stumbling is a great distroyer of predilection. WoW
29,Mon January 29,01/1912,January,"Slept late and and Sl called up early to insist on my going with him to lunch at the Thomas house with Mr T. to day. I did a lot of things and was ready for him at I'3o.  Extraordinary place and person. A young man tall and charming. with fine dark eyes and the whole thing a gothic dream. We had lunch at end of long table. and he showed us everythi all over the house including the wine cellar where hams were hanging. .. and his great green tiled bath. Was determined that Sl and I should dine there on tues instea of Sl with me. so we arranged it. I left soon and came home to rest and had a fine one.  Jack came and was reconciled . Harry had changed the tickets for Sumurum where he and I were going and we three dined downstairs and went off in taxi very jolly.

30,Tues January 30,01/1912,January,"Worked on Mr Clement and got three pics off to Wash .. Quite a relief.and clearance. A good deal of writing and fussing to do about many things. These are stirring times I am dizzy.  Went in to 24 for the first time in many days and was greeted as the 'debutante'. Had much to tell. Got my self off but was late going in to the 'little milionaires'. Found it looking exquisite and the others there. Prince Pierre TroubetsKoy.. the painter ..husband of Amelie Rives.. Mr A Talbot Jones very dainty friend of Sl a young Russian and the  french artist Hoffbauer I met at the Wilkie fiasco. a Miss Courtney very proper and mild to make it convenable. I suppose but she seemed to be an ahabitue. A Mrs Williams came after the chaperone I suppose. I sat between Prince T and Sl. Delightful talk about my Fathere chiefly and religion that is Piety ', This was all charming but we went on after to a Mrs Guiness' rather doubtful.. I think The slave girl from Sumurun a very modest German girl was ther and Mme Simone.  Many much dressCd and not very alluring people. Fine old house on N Wash Sq. Home very late and said goodbye to Sl."

Then wrote accomplishing quite a little 'thanks.'
82,Fri March 22,03/1912,March,Pretty good night and up betimes.. expecting Kremer. At ten punctually and dress too light as I feared. I shall have to subdue it with chiffon. and var ious divices. She brought Rienzi to read and nice girl came and read every moment. Feel a little puzzled over background.   Was ready for Fitchie and party at four but they did not come till half past the usual way. Mr C. Dekay called up ask to come. Is to write about me for 'Good housekeeping.'

Dunn came at seven with taxi. looking very beautiful.   To the Lafayette Ratyer risque and very gay .. But we had very serious talk. and always so much to say.. I hope I was not too flatteur.. Back in pour and then dear time reading. I introduced him to Geo Herbert and we spent a precious hour on the sofa.. both having had the ex7erience of religion and knowing what it meant.. He stayed till eleven. Such times dont happen often. We also talked a good deal of A.P.A and he made some pretty keen criticisma of him .. They would never like each other. and I almost fear I talked too freely. It would be so hard for ANY one to understand my position. He wished to leave the subject and we soon passed to othere things.  I could watch his beautiful smooth black head and white forhead and never tire. He has the LOOK of thought in his actual modelling of his face.
85,Mon March 25,03/1912,March,Woke feeling very guilty about having talked so about A.P.A. but in the mail was letter from him . meant to be nice but reflecting the tone of the atmoshere he breathes now.. He actually invited me to Green Alley . and has got the little devorcee with Ethel Roosevelt to come to R R for Easter. I am sure he has made her believe that I am coming. Mrs Gardner also..   Could not quite do it without giving me some kind of  n invite . but who else would would have thought of inviting Ethel without me..... I wrote an answer that day refusing aimiably enough. I did not feel resentful chiefly because I did not fee much. any way.   Nothing from Sl. who he says is to have two or three people at Beauport. I am very glad that my excuse is a real one. I cannot leave my work now and would not even if I wanted to do it. Went out in aft to see the Portrait Ex. and met Tucker there and Dr Dade . Poor show and a stuffy velvet lined place without daylight.  Ernesta's head the only thing I sent. Found Clayton Johns when I got back . So pathetic but much better than I feared. Nice talk and hope he will come again. Then Mrs. Low.  Din here and sat with Mrs G after . Rather depressing.
86,Tues March 26,03/1912,March,Wonderful day .. Mrs K. and reading Dombey . Head had stayed wet and I went right on with it.  Just like a Gilbert Stuart I dont mean the pic but her head.  Worked till after one and and was dead tired. Long rest and int by a model who almost scared me. T o t red to walk but went in to Mrs Rumsey'd and gossipped Din here and with the Glenny's after . looking at mags. Nice note from Wilkie who has been ill. .. Wrote to him at once. ..
87,Wed March 27,03/1912,March,Wonderful morning and started out early on top of bus for many errands and picture shows. First to 57 st and soon met Walter Palmer there. Pretty bad lot of pics but if it had not so warm and my furs so heavy would have had a very jolly time jollying with Mr P. We then went off to the Ten Painters. Weir the only good .. others much gone off. To Madison Gallery to see pics of young Weiss. asked to bu Mr Taylor. Then to Of tosee about Mrs Clement and home dead beat. Anna had good lunch for me and the photos of the Wash pics ha come Haeseler.. Pretty good only proofs. QAt last queer little note from Jack . A great effort. The dear boy needs a little neglect.  Don't think he has written to either the Glennys or Gilders a shame. I shall take no responsibility about this. Was resting and finishing Leonora when Ros called and I went in Ditson's motor with Helena. to park .. and tea there after Also later to 24 to din and with H and girls after So good to have her up and actually sewing. Read me a long int letter f from Nannie Sedgwick.   Note from Wilkie saying he was to be at the Guerin's din on Thurs. Wish I could take him to the Fairchilds after.
88,Thurs March 28,03/1912,March,Rather dark but Kremer came and I got on very well throat and jewel. A green button of mine instead of her pearls. Reast in aft and no one came .. To Guerin's dinner at 730 in scarlet satin. Wilkie there but did not sit by me alas. Came for ard very empresse looking very pale. Delightful time at table between Pres Finley and Guerin.  Fine talk with F. and it was hard to have to leave for the Fairchils party before the men came up. W rushed out and caught me on way up stairs but was not going. Party at Colony club. Durbar moving pictures Wonderful and very pleasant after though not thrilling Welling told me Wilkie was over working Two kinds of business.  Back feeling rather depressed.

Lunch there and found Anne when I got back  The coming operation casts a shadow but she is very brave.  Long rest and no real fresh air. 0 yes I went in car alone to Bartrams garden. a bleak trip not like the other time. No word from Wilkie and I was disappointed and dont understand.

Got note off to Dunn asking him to come to sup tomorrow or Sat.. Nothing from W and it gets queerer.. Decided to go there and inquire and call on Miss Brown the lame sister.. and after rest got myself up and went. Found her in her chair in parlor having tea.. Was given some idea of the illness but not much. Comes down to meals and refuses care. which makes it queerer. Little boys ran in and I left abruptly as the littlest announced supper. Walked back. and went in to din at 24.   Helena has been out. Fran and Ros went to Theater with Reese Alsop. JayChapin's fiance.. and I sat all evening by fire with H. while she embroidered for her coming grandchild.

Th only bright spot. Hav'nt even any book yo read but Bergson's Laughter. No word from Ethel Roosevelt about going to G. This is Queer too.

Quite gay and felt Mrs K was pretty superior. Mr K thanked me with almost a break in his voice. Young Slater to see the frame. D came back and stayed pretty late and I was anxious for a little more rest before going to Mrs Van to din to meet Mr Kent my kinsman..Very nice time sat between him and Durand. Young Wheelock poet also there, and had good talk with him after din. Durand rode off with me and was very aggreeable. Thought J.W. might be there. and was sorry though all was  so good Mrs Van will come to visit me in autumn."
151,Sat June 1,06/1912,June,"..A great day. J.W. called up about going out to Tuxedo..I kept the pictures for more varnishing but did many chores and shopping a while. Rest, and at four J.W. with auto (hired for the occasion). and we wheeled off after he had seen the pics and preferred Mrs P. Very gay and light. Rather rough going, but pretty all the way and new to me...Tuxedo much more striking and int than I expected..High hills near together, and a lake that lies between, and looks like the Rhine. We drew up at a house opening down from the road new and handsome. Two dear little boys ran out and a french man servant. Then the wonderful cripple Aunt Ethel Brown rolled herself forward.. .. The house is shallow and the feature is the steep hill that pitches down at back to the valley and river. A great balcony hangs into the tree tops. I was allowed to go up and choose my room and saw the whole house. I had a great delightful room overlooking the valley with its own bath and every luxury. I put on my new evening. Warpaint J.W. called it when I came down. We three alone and so gay and perfectly RIGHT...J.W. charming of course and in a teasing mood. After din we sat in the big drawing room talking busily when we suddenly remembered outside and went out on the balcony. What a spectacle. I shall never forget it nor when nor where it was. Down down into the dark deep valley with twinkling lights here and there .. A great mountain flank opposite night color. and above the full m moon sailing up in splendor through the deepest richest blue .. Around us gently swaying in warm night air the tops of great trees catching the here and there the tender light of the moon and revealing form as only moonlight can. We sat for a while and then Ethel B went to bed and J.W. and I leaned long on the rail looking into it and talking of very deep nd sacred things. He spoke of his wife and her sister, and told me their story..We talked of faith and religion and I told hime my wonderful early experience. At 12 we went up and he took me with a candle to the little boys room, dark and moontouched too, and we looked at their lovely sleeping faces, and then knelt by the window looking into the trees, and listening to the Whippoorwill and breathing the wood odors. It was a wonderful time and when I got to bed I lay close to the open window and saw the stars as I slept and waked. One of the best times"
152,Sun June 2,06/1912,June,"The sun poured in over the valley just as the moon had done, and they brought my break while I was in my bath, so I got back into bed,and presently a knock introduced the two boys in clean white with a big plate of strawberries and cream.. They were charming, sent by Tante and quite ready to make friends J.W. did not appear at once when I cam down but I found the boys climbing over their aunt.  I could never express what she is . A complete cripple entirely with out use of her legs from waist down.. Live, intellectual, even gay, and entirely without complaint though a great sufferer. Doing the housekeeping and really bringing up the boys .tho gh J.W. is a perfect father and helper. The boys wanted me to see  their things and we were soon playing Parcheesi and Flag.. J.W. came and said 'And he doesnt know that he h the Queen of Hearts sitting right in front of him......Think of my having such as that said to me NOW. We went for a walk and then lunch and I went to rest as I cannot hold out long.A woman came to call and there was no more wonder . though J.W. read us his speech for tomorrow night.  And we had much good talk  The balcony again for a short time.. but of course not the boys again. and that was all. Thunder shower so no moon and a great blow."
153,Mon June 3,06/1912,June,Got up early to pack as we left betimes. All at   br break and J.W. very  attentive and dear to the boy and me. a disciplined soul. without priggishness or solemnity.  To station in bus from the door with other men and when we spoke of Europe he be came very serious and stayed so. Train too crowded to sit together and the VanSinderins took possession of me. Sat on window ledge for a time and a few very serious words. Inunderground to station in town and in taxi to door. Nothing special but he very quiet. and I felt something not known for long. Said good bye at door. Found much to do at once. Hot. Work at things all day and Anne B in eve. Anna got off for B at one. Anne and I in Gran Park in eve for a while.

Also before leaving in the quiet of Anne's spare room I wrote a letter to J.W.   Had time to rest after lunch and get off in 4.3 Rain and took Reed .. Anna and Natale very welcoming and the place looking very well INSIDE but the grass foot and a half high and making all desolate of course  New room and windows very pleasing and full of promise and the little gable not very funny. Bridget smiling in kitchen and a comfort to be sure.   S1 soon after supper.. No one else here .. Of course the new erection atbthe corner a horror .. I began at once to plan to hide it.

Everything so comfy . and delicious break brought up at just the right time with lovely rose on tray. also bunch of orchids from Mrs Day who alas is not here.   Got myself ready to go out en matin white and was calling up Etta at the Whitneys when Mr Woolsey came ..so delightful to see him polished and deep-voiced as ever. Was enjoying him when Lee Mc Clung ca came .. Neither stayed long and Etta rolled up with Mrs Whitney .. Fine big car and we went to the Bennetts. I wanted E to see the pics and the place too.   It looked beautiful in summer glory and Hope was there not Mrs B. and more gracious than she used to be. Both pics looked well . I was proud of them actually. and it was a joy to show them to E. Ern came to in another car with one of the W girls. Then we went for go in the auto and back in time fo lunch at the Hadleys . Not Etta but some other women not very int . All the men of course a e fo gathering with thei Reunions. Young and old . Big cars came for us and we got off soon after lunch to the Ball Game. Heaps of Autos . Ours December with blue flags. To Royal box of cou course and we were a little late as the marching and carreering of the classes in their costumes was going round. Wonderful Arab s Bedouins. and ahuge green caterpi lar made of men . Also a group on camels Bands playing and cutting up gene ally while the teams worked themselves up catching and pitching just below us . I dont know the game but got a little of it from Mrs H and Mr Bennet who sat on my othe side .Yale won but it was said to be a poor game.   The cheering 'led was the ,ost inspiring thing tha happened...Arthur Lud was there sitting near us. He was a Bedouin.  Then the e was a great procession and dancing of the  Alumni.in their costumes and we ha to leave expecting to see them later at the Hadleys.   Mrs H had a Tea and the Classes all came up to the side door where Mr H addressed them each appropriatel We had to rush and dre s for very du l dinner at 8 where I sat on hosts right and had to drag him throu  1912 Yale M.A."
168,Wed June 19,06/1912,June,The great day .. Woke wondering how I was going to put on mortar board.. Was very glad I had my little blk silk as it was just the thing . Ihad no color or anything feminine except my patent shoes with buckles and si silk stockings. Got the cap on right at last by very ca eful hair a  angement. but pinned tight so it would not come off.    Mrs   approved and after fortifying myself with sherry and educaters which I really needed even then we got off in wagon. Drove up to I dont know what Hall where Mr H met us and escorted me up stairs where all the Digs were assembled. Old Pres Dwight They at once formed the precession and I had a Mr Kelsey by me .. one of the Corporation. First came the Sec ca  ying a huge mace. Then Pres Hadley and Pres Dwight. The rest of us Hon Degs directly after with Photographer running a alongside. all the time. getting what theyobstructed could. It was a perfect day and we walked far through lines of people. It was all I could do but I cheered my self on and wished for more nerve staying power to enjoy it with.   The sun was hot and we halted several time going through courts and squares and the green. Before we got to Woolsey Hall we walked through lines of students uncovered and finally by a band tremendous for me almost splitting with feelings Still process through the Hall and up on the platform when I had a front corner seat and was glad of my chaussure. Seas of Students below and galleries full of people.  Prayer was made and splendid hymns sung by every body . It was almost more than I could stan and I was provoked that I had to hold on so.    There was no ortation nor speech of any kind . but it took long to confer all the regular degrees. (See program) Mr Eddy who got Sci Doc sat on my right Mr Woolsey the Orator on my left close by.   I was tremendously proud to be associated with Goethals . but I felt like telling them that as to Mc Vegh I knew who did his work for him. It was his 5oth annaversary. When my turn came I seemed to gather strength and stood up facing the crowd while Mr Woolsey read my 'description'.. Then I had to turn and go up to the President who with even more flattering words handed me the precious roll tied wi with blue ribbon and the Marshalls put the hood over my head.. It is charming . such a grand blue. After that I did not have to waver more and could enjoy every minute.. Of course there was big applause But Goethals got the most as was hs due.  I was taken in hand by two or three and a Mr Sargent and tried to find Etta No go and then went back to the Pres office when all were assembled for the luncheon . I was doubtful about this as no other woman had done it but was persuaded by the H's and all Mc Veagh was very polite and came up saying at last he was in my class. Talked with Vance and others. Then to the Commons where I soon saw what I would have missed if I had not done it. Immense Hall filled wit tables for the Alumni. and long table in the Gallery at end looking down for US.  Pres Had in middle with Pres Dwight next him Goethals Then Sir Alf Eas and then ME. with Sargent on other side . My spirit were almost too much . but S seemed to enjoy it. and I had good talk with both. Speeches began soon. Old Pres D first and very touching.

I asked to come to din tonight and acceped gladly.   Rest and was watering in upper terrace when Sl came with atms full of news papers and much to tell.     about the event . Invite from Brooks to go on the battle ship but too much .   H appeared again and we were in upper l when Mrs Grey came .. Full on fire as usual but very tired . Dressed in scarlet and blue over with spangles . Halls and A last . Din in dining room. on acct of awful skites. A looking very pale but very beautiful. and transparent with thought and excitement ..

Came down looking better and full of her old spirit. We were going around and were by the wood pool when A.P.A shouted from the road came around by path saying what was that Melba call 'In the Wood.' Hr was particularly nice . Took her off and she left from there.    Got things ready for Mrs Smith in studio and she came early brave but very wheezy .. had not slept and I fear. but we began and I found delightful arrangements in white very soon. with Mamma's blue scarf. A strange pleasure to use it. We got it so soon that there was no need of further worry and she got off at twelve.    Did not see anymore of A but Sl came in at five to arrange about his guests and broke the news thaB there were three women instead of one. Of course this might have been guessed easily before by a more s uspicious person than I am.    Wanted me to have allsorts of extreme things like two tables . dinner out in loggia but I sat on this at once . pleading mosquitoes.   Tried to influence him to not make such a frantic rush for effective crowding of places visited, and he pretended to acquiesce.    Said he would come in again in eve but did not . I took walk and went to bed early."
185,Sat July 6,07/1912,July,Ter ible struggle to get lobsters . and contrive a dinner . Dont pay .. FOR ME.. and at ten Mrs Smithls friend came to say that she was in bed after a wretched night . and feared she would have to give it up now . We had a pleasant talk and I convinced her that ot could not be postponed till next winter. if she cannot go on next week.   I am rather glad..   I fusse about getting thins attended to and seeing the men put the last trees in on the hill. Gave up lobsters and ordered mackerel. Wow.    May suddenly appeared at lunch time . I bathed Very warm. Rest and expecting A Ludington who came a at six . A joy to have him. Dressed in new evening Heard nothing from Sl and would not have been surprise at any failure. or breakdown.    But he called up and they all came at about 7.45. One rather sweet blonde girl very adoring to me.. and two others perfectly impersonal. though very civilized.. but not at all worth the fuss. Sl was makin and extracting from me.    Din went very well and we went up on upper terrac which I had lighted with lanterns.    A .P.A came and after a short descent to the studi which Sl evedently thought superflous.. we went to R.R. The usual pproceedurs through doors and finally A played on the orchestrelle always welcome when anevening wants to be finished.  Sl actually suggested before we went over that we should send for Mrs Hall to play for us . I sat on this at once. A.P.ZA did not accompany t_ his gate and I dont think he will do this now that the invasion has Baken place.
186,Sun July 7,07/1912,July,Lovely morning. and we three had break together .   A Lud so exquisite and charming to have in every way .. I propose our going for a walk and we soon got off . I felt really free and we went through Raymond woods .. perfectly lovely and to Morning joy where we sat very near the edge of the crisp pure incoming tide and had splendid talk.. about E and all.    Back at twelve to find a Mr Waldo had been here let of int from Mrs de P Tytus. Said would return .. at five.   Delicious bath and quiet lunch and rest. At lunch Sl called up inviting us there to din but I declined as we were all prepared here and A coming. He said the Waldo party were coming there. And I said I would gonin with A.L. at same time.   Did not however Too tired and wanting to save up a little.    Sent May with A.L. and got pools etc ready. Am getting tired of doing this.      He kept them there and they did not get here till nearly 5.30 while I waited Sl told them it was earlier.    Waldo brought his wonderful viola and was a very rewarding person . Strong and a little pathetic which showe dhwen he played as he did later in the comfort to have a little music.            At 7.30 A P A and a litle din of four . but A.L. seemed shy and would not come out so was heavy work at din and A was bored. I was glad the dinner was so good and simple.  Delicious straw berries.     After up in the loggia got on gay subject and had much laughter. Sl came over and pressed my hand meaningly .. but not much good.   A very nice and I somehow fear this is not to be happy time for him There was a splendid notice in the Transcript. much more than a notic  . a very understanding article. but I fear the uproar will die out and then what..
187,Mon July 8,07/1912,July,   Very hot .. Rather late getting at breakfast. Carpenters working at round window at vast expense A. Lud got off for Annisquam for the day..    I actually got a green curtain for door in my room .. and mattresses came . No other events. May and I alone at lunch.    Sort of rest after. but no good reading.    Fussing about and at about six A Lud came back So inspiriting to have him . for without necessary insisting work I ahev no strength of rht least thing cannot even write .. We had din out the first time in spite of pests. and were sitting up in the upper loggia when Sl came .. Ingratiating but several scratches were exchanged. He wanted to read a letter from Mc Clung. a propos of the great affair.. and did later . downstairs . I did not walk to gate .. The papers are ceasing to speak of it. Mrs Gardner came down for two hours . (he said) .. Of course I did not see.   Leila Mechlin called up . and is to come to lunch on Thurs. That will be nice.    It is dark to think of the dear ones in this heat.
188,Tues July 9,07/1912,July,Intensely hot . but we all got ready for the Ripleys to send the auto to take me to Andover and A Lud to Bev. Post late so did not get letter till late saying they would not send . Old lady too done up by heat. Wasted most of the morning but not much matter this. A.Lud read to me in West Cloister ah while I sewed on curtain and this was good and alive. He went at 12. and I bathed in soup. .    Natale spent the aft in G. and A and I watered. Anne B called up roasting at Merrill Hall and I was delighted to have her come here and stay to sup ..    We had it out and she was so cheering and brisk. as always. I am a dope these days for sure.    I do not even lookinto the studio. It got lowering and we hoped for rain .. but none . Not for four weeks now.     A. went home early . but not before had appeared just as we went to din . Just  from town with a small parcel from me. I had to open it then with very significant looks from him .A charming little cigarette mouth piece. amber.. I am to bought back to complacency. I took it cordially and was much surprised.. May and I went to the Halls but they were out and the colored butler was playing on the piano. It got much cooler in the night and I ha d to seek more cocers.
189,Wed July 10,07/1912,July,A really terrible day.. I became quite demorolized wandered around lying down and getting up and terribly depressed. Managed to finish and put up green curtain .. and tried taking bathafter break to get good tide but did not long for it though the water was exquisite. Could not help anxiety abou the three dear boys in Phila. Late in the aft Mr Hall came over to ask me to go out with them in the auto. This was a great relief and pleasant to be with them . It was cool doing this of course.  After sup and May and I trying to find a place to be possible from the mosks I went down to the studio and actually tried the piano feeling helplessly about and so longing to do it. May came down and my dreanings had to cease.. She WILL follow me about and I cant do anything.   I stopped and went out on the pier and soon saw a white trousered person go into the Halls and ring . Thought it was A.P.A.but it soon emerged with out waiting for the Halls to ans and I heard my name called.   It was Sl .. We both r rejoiced and the strain was over. I cannot remember long and his misdemeanors were not serious. We wandered till I got chilly.and of course I heard a few more details about A.P.A. I called them up at supper time to speak to Mrs A. he ans ..pleasant but I dont know what they are all thingking.. I shall do no more now.. Chas Grafly called up to say he cannot come to lunch but tells me he is expecting Joe Pennell. That will be amising.   A pleasant young plasterer has been at work today on the round window . and much deverted by my costumes tho striving to conceal it.
190,Thurs July 11,07/1912,July,Cooler and toward noon great thunderstorm .. We were in the midst and terrific claps . Nothing struck just here. I had come to life before and done some much needed garden work . tying up etc before.   There was no wind to speak of and sheets of rain three or four separate showers. I still hoped for Leila Mechlin for lunch but she did not come .. Telephone is down . Rest and reading Christophe but not much int.. Saw A going to call at the Halls. Sl in town. More and more rain what a blessing. .. Note from A Lud and a good letter from J.W. .. Is coming for the 28. I wrote to him in afB and the postman tokk mine when leaving his.   Tried to walk after sup alone but too muggy and came back to lie on rug till bed time.   J.W. does not take the view of A.P.A that we do. and I fear that this means that such business men as he feel the same way . O I hope it was not a mistake. I fear he felt too sure of himself.. He has brought down all before himtill now. I wrote and invited Lee McClung to come here to visit. It is funny to remember how A scorned him before.
191,Fri July 12,07/1912,July,Overcast and cool. I felt quite nifty and did a lot of vine work all the weeding of the lower garden bed. While I was finishing just before din Sl appeared with two notes to read one from Miss Hitchcock and one from Waldo both very flattering. They are now longing to have McClung's letter published and I told him I had written to MC C asking him to come up. Deep but broken rest after lunch by plasterer outsid of my window but the round window is now finished all but the iron bars.   D. came at 4.30 while I was on the upper terrace with my feet in the pooo which had just been filled and looked deliciously pure.. Perfe ct aft sun and too lovely on the upper terrace.   Jolly to have D come and we were still up there when Leila Mechlin was announced. So glad to see her Anna brought tea and when May and D went off we had quite a talk about A.P.A. She understands perfectly Mc Veagh's impossibilities and aggravating ways. Wish I could have whem meet. While we were dining on the west terrace Jack sudden ly appeared . Too delicious to see him and he was so dear and affectionate and very beautiful. We were very gay He went up on upper terrace for a while but of course had to go back soon to A. I was walking part way back with him when we met the Halls who were coming here. Nice visit from them talking music . . on ly D's allusions are always on the side of small casual bits of gossip about it purely personal When I was aking L M to the gate the Halls and Miss Davison and Miss Hawley came along . All peacefu till one of the Siamese appeared with a villanous white English bull terrier . who flew at poor little Micky and nearly destroyed him. I rushed for pepp er and in the mean time Mr H had beaten them apart. and the Siamese livid and angry was holding his beast by the collar and Mr H was threatening him with police.
192,Sat July 13,07/1912,July,Exquisite day . I did not sleep well on the little bed in the guest room .. I ha d my break out in the upper terrace and the others down on the lower Only while they sat in peace and beauty I had to s spen a half hour with B in the kitchen ordering meal for two days. We were all up in the upper terrace when Jack cam smiling up .. enchanting boy .. I read a little to from Deirdre of the Sorrows sent by A Ludington . and he and D and I walked out to the Breakwater. Exquisite. and he undressed and went in looking like a golden god. (running drawers ) . He came in with us and we found note from A.P.A asking D to com to lunch.. The Meyer girls and Helen Taft were coming I did not care a hoot for going to this party .. and was glad to have D go .. We three then went in to bathe and while J was dressing in the studio Sl came looking from him and he told us afterwards was very angry and told him that if he wanted to help A he would come at once and play tennis with him I did not see Sl nor all day.

The Pugh girls came in auto two nice well dressed pretty girls and asked us to lunch with them on Tue As they invited ys to go to see the Spaulding garden I accepted. We then rushed off to the Davisons where we found A.P.A calling and Mr Hall. I felt very stiff and prickly .. Which I fegretted and tried not to show. We soon left leaving them there. and on the way home Jack sprang out and came home with us. Would come in to sup though I tried not to have him as I knew A wanted him and would not like it but he would stay and we had it outside and were very gay. Could not make him go and went to the studio. Where I had idea to get him over there. Proposed our all g ing to R.R. which we did. seing Sl on way at Halls dining. We made a rush in the R.R and it was well . They were sitting in the daVk. A at once began apologizing for not having asked me evidently thinking I was vexed at THAT . I rushed to him prote es ing . and then we sat down and he talked long and confidentially about his affairs.. A new phase Bo see him anxious.. It was poignant .and cut me to the heart . I could not bear it any more than I could to see Harry D in such a new position. 0 it MUST come out right for him . He deserves it for such a bold righteous protest. He played for us on the orchestrelle after.
