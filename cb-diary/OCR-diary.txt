Tues Jan 2

Woke full of the ones TI had met so nearly last night with
a consciousness of what dearth there is of contacts I desire
This mist be I suppose. Wrote and went out .. short
run . Scanty lunch here and rest . Then dow to Susan and
Madge Huntington's studio in S Wash Sq. How reminding of old
days. Fine place and very artificial lly brital work ..
Sone how right though as decoration . Jolly talk with Jonas
Lie who was there. Hardly anyone else. Walked up and seemed
Short . Left card on Miss Bigelow and Mrs Guerin. out alas.

Wed Jan 3d.

Went out early shopped and wrote . Qucer days these but I
need the rest and it is good for a while. Was ready at

anna of course always. Persuaded Fitchie to go with me to the
Rrench’s to see his Lincoln now on view. Walked down and founc
crowd at 5.30. Was tremendously impressed. It is MY Lincoln
and I think all who care for him will feel it. It is ordingary
a@plastically. but great in concevtion and feeling. for the PER-
SON. Saw many people of course Met Tracy going out . and shall
not have him here He returns next winter. Dr Valentino ..
The Johnsons and many others . At last caught sight of John
Wilkie coming in and that was the end of the other people.
He told me that his adoratio n of Lincolm when he was a boy
was so great tha’? he called himself after hin. D was there
and I had a chance to tell Mr French what I thought of IT.
He seemd pleased. J L, W. walked all the way home with us.
I like himalways better. Makes me think sometimes of LANGLEY.

vant. Then the wonderful crinple Annt Ethel Brown
rolled hevself forward.. .. The house is shallow and
the feature is the steen hill that pitches down at
back to the valdey and river . A great balcony hangs

into the tree tops. I was allowed to £0 up and choo

form as only moonlight can.
We sat for a while and then Ethel B went to hed

it and talking of very deep nd sacred things.
He spoke of his wife and her sister,and told me the
story..We talked of faith and religion and [I told

worry and she got off at twelve.

Wed July IOth. ~
A really terible day.. I became quite demorolized
wandered around Lying down and getting up and ter
ibly depressed. Managed to finish and put up green
curtain .. and tried taking bathafter break to get
good tide but did not long for it though the water
was exquisite. Could not help anxiety abou the three
dear boys in Phila. Late in the aft Mr Hall came ove
to ask me to go out with them in the auto. This was a
great relief and pleasant to be with them . Tt was
cool doing this of course.
After sup and May and T trying to find a place to
be possible from the mosks I went down to the studi
and actually tried the piano feeling helplessly
about and so longing to do it. May came down and
my dreanings had to cease... She WILL follow me about
and IT cant do anything. T stopved and went out
on the pier and soon saw a white trousered person £0
into the Halls and ring . Thought it was A.P.A.but
it soon emerged with out waiting for the Halls to ans
and T heard my name called. Tt was Sl .. We both
rejoiced and the strain was over. I cannot remember
long and his misdemeanors were not serious.

We wandered till TI got chilly.and of course I heard

JW. doea@ not take the view of A.P-A that we do.
and I fear that this means that such business men as
he feel the same way . 0 T hope it was not a mistake.
T fear he felt too sure of himself... He has brought
down all before himtil? now. I wrote and invited
Lee McClung to come herve to visit. Tt 1s funny to
remember how A scorned him before. ©
Fri July Ieth.
Overcast and cool. I felt quite nifty and did
a lot of vine work and all the weeding of the lower
garden bed. While I was finishing just before
din Sl apvveared with two notes to read one fr Miss
Hitchcock and one fr Waldo both very flattering.
They are now longing to have McClung's letter pub
lished and I told nim T had written to Me C asking
him to come up. Deep but broken rest after lunch
by phasterer outsid of my window but the round windo
is now finished all put the iron bars.

D. came at 4.30 while I was on the upper ter ace

with mv feet in the pooo which had just been filled
and looked deliciously vure.. Perfe ct aft sun and
too lovely on the upver tervace.

Jolly to have D come and we were still up there
when Leila Mechlin was announced. So gliad to see her
Anna brought tea and when May and D went off we had

quite a talk about A.P.A. She understands perfectly}
Mc Veagh's impossibilities and aggravating ways.
Wish I could have whem meet.
While we were dining on the west ter:ace Jack sudde€
ly avneared . Too delicious to see him and he was so
dear and affectionate and very beautiful. We were
very gay He went up on upper terrace for a while
but of course had to go back soon to A. I was walking
part way back with him when we met the Halls who weré
coming here. Nice visit from them talking misic .. 0
ly Dts allusions are always on the side of small
casual bits of sossinp about it purety personal

When I was aking L M to the rate the Halls and
Miss Davison and Miss Hawley came along . All peace
till one of the Siamese anneared with a villanous
white English bull terrier . who flew at poor little

Micky and nearly destroyed him . I rushed for pepp
er and in the mean time Mr H had beaten them apart.
and the Siamese livid and angry was holding his
beast by the collar and Mr H was threatening him with
yvolice.
Sat July IS3th.
Exquisite day . I did not sleep well on the
little bed in the puest room .. I ha da my break out

Like a golden god. (running drawers ) - He came in
with us and we found note fr AeP.A asking D to cor
to lunch.. The Meyer girls and Helen Taft were coming
I did not care a hoot for going to this party ..

and was flad to hive D go .. We three then went
in to bathe and while J was dressing in the studio
Sl came Looking fr him and he told us afterwards

help A he would come at once and play tennis with hin

I did not see Sl nor all dag. D came back at fou
with mich to tell . Tt was quite a large party and

like but she did not seem to know...
The Pugh girls came in auto two nice well dressed
pretty girls and asked us to lunch with them on Tu
. As they invited ys to fo to see the Spaulding garden
I accepted.

We then rushed off to the Davisons where we
found A.eP.A calling and Mr Hall. I felt very
stiff and prickly .. which I ferretted and tried no

to show. We soon left leaving them there. and on
the way nome Jack svrang out and came home with us.
Would come in to sup though I tried not to have hi
as I knew A wanted him and would not like it but
he would stay and we had it outside and were very
gay. Could not make him go and went to the studio.
where I had idea to get him over there . Proposed
our all g ing to R.R. which we did. seing Sl on wa
at Halls dining. We made a rush in at R.R and it
was well . They were sitting in the da’k. A at one
began apolorizing for not havins asked me evidently
thinking I was vexed at THAT . I mshed to him prot
es ing . and then we sat down and he talked long and
confidentially about his affairs... A new phase
No see him anxious... It was poignant .dnd cut me to
the heart . Ico ld not »exr it any more than [ coul
to see Harry D in such a new vosition. O it MUST
come out right for him . He deserves it for sucha
bold righteous protest. He pviayed for us on the
orchestrelle afte”.
