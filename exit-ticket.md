### Exit Ticket

- I feel like this class has immediately made me more creative with my programming and ways of studying history
  - Prior to this course, my main idea of digital history was like, maybe just a webiste that talks about history???
- I literally never used Hypothesis even though it really excited me initially
  - Did not automatically activate in my browser
  - It went against my typical workflow --> readings done on iPad but Hypothesis not avaliable on mobile
    - Maybe I'll try to contribute to the development of mobile interface
  - Just kept forgetting about it until long after I had done the readings bc of these reasons
- Feel like I neglected the collaborative aspect of this class in the most "academic" sense --> did not use Hypothesis to discuss readings in the margins
- Feel like I'm more creative in seeking solutions, maybe even more determined because I understand the reward?
  - DRIVEN to learn new techniques that can make analysis better and easier
  - Could have manaually edited the OCR'd journal of Cecilia Beaux, but instead I challenged myself to learn something new, giving me stronger data, making the process of data cleaning faster, and digital analysis stronger
- Felt like I was compelled by the things I explored and discovered using digital history within the archive, but struggled to form or express a compelling narrative from my discoveries
  - I would get too technical or too focused on the details, which would result a complex outcome that I found difficult to explain
  - TAKE AWAY: The details were my favourite part, but not neccessarily good for a broader explanation --> work on exploring "big picture"/broader themes?
- Easiest to weave my historical observations in with my technical ones

### Q&A

**How have you grown?**

* I'm a better programmer, even though it was a history. I learned to work and research independently without given resources.
* I also got better at pattern recognition and broader analyses.
* I curated my digital workflow
  -  LEAD INTO FAILURES: literally never used Hypothesis even though it really excited me initially
    - Did not automatically activate in my browser
    - It went against my typical workflow --> readings done on iPad but Hypothesis not avaliable on mobile

**Did you help others - or did someone else make a difference for you?**

* In the discord, I love helping others a lot because it made me question what I known.

**How did week 6 pan out for you?**

* I'm overly ambitious. I took on a difficult archive and was too stubborn to give it up. This led to me learning an entirely new skill, while not neccessarily bad, it led to me performing more the of the physical part of digital history rather than the analytical.
  -  Could have manaually edited the OCR'd journal of Cecilia Beaux, but instead I challenged myself to learn something new, giving me stronger data, making the process of data cleaning faster, and digital analysis stronger
  - At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective. --> during the course I felt like tools were explianed to us already from a historical perspective, but when I was learning web scraping, it was the first time I myself had to think of how a tool might be used in a historical context (all the stuff online was usually not directly applicable to history)
* I struggled to find a balance between analyzing and doing.
  - occasionally I enjoyed the technical work more than the thinking work.
* Another outcome will be the ability to translate the results of digital methods into historical argument.
  * Week 6 feels like the first time I was able to genuinely produce a historical argument from using digital methods

**Could you take what you’ve learned and apply it in another course - or do you still feel hesitant about certain aspects?**

* I feel hesistant creating an entire work based on reseach using digital history tools. I think it's an excellant starting for further historical research. I'm hesistant to create work based entirely on assumptions from imperfect tools. I will apply this to other classes, however, as it gives me a starting point of where to look.
* This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past.

**Can you contrast what you now know about digital history with what you thought about the subject when you started out back in May?**

- I feel like this class has immediately made me more creative with my programming and ways of studying history
  - Prior to this course, my main idea of digital history was like, maybe just a webiste that talks about history???
* In may, I assumed digital history was open source history, mainly digital exhibitions.

**Was there a single moment when things crystalized for you? What else do you wish you’d gotten to try?**

* There was never a moment that "crystalized" for me, it was more like moments that excited me about the possibilities of digital history.
* I don't really want to suggest a grade for myself, becuase regardless I will be happy with the outcome of this course becuase of what it's taught me
